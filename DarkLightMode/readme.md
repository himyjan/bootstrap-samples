Bootstrap 5.3 Dark Mode has not been fully addressed so this project is for working out things.

**From Bootstrap docs**

Bootstrap provides custom :[focus](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/customize/css-variables/#focus-variables) styles using a combination of Sass and CSS variables that can be optionally added to specific components and elements. **We do not yet globally override all :focus styles**.
