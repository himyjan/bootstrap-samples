# Using Bootstrap with ASP.NET Core/Razor Pages

The main intent of these code samples is to show how to integrate various Bootstrap components into Razor Pages and will work with ASP.NET Core with little change.

Why do this? Because in some of Bootstrap documentation is not easy to figure out how to properly put things together such as toast notifications that stack. Go check the web and most third party samples lack here too.

Each project name begins with the version of Bootstrap as time goes by there will be Bootstrap 6. Next is followed by the component targeted.

> **Note**
> In some cases I did minimal amount of coding that is non Bootstrap to get things done like using Request.Form rather than proper methods to get at data. The main focus is Bootstrap.
